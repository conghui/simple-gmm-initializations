This file contains a description of the parameters that define our artificial data sets and the generation process.
For information on how to ...
* define description files for generated data, see files in the 'descriptors' folder.
* run the testlab or generate csv's containing these generated data sets, see the 'Getting Started.txt'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Parameters
------------

N		number of data points
D		dimension
K		number of clusters used by the intialization/algorithm
GEN_K		number of clusters used to generate the data
W		floating point exponent for weight generation
Separation	separation as defined by dasgupta & schulman
EW-exp		floating point exponent for generation of minimum eigenvalues
EW-min		minimum value for min(sqrt(eigenvalue))
EW-max		minimum value for min(sqrt(eigenvalue))
EWP-min 	lower bound on (maximum sqrt(eigenvalue))/(maximum sqrt(eigenvalue)) 
EWP-max 	upper bound on (maximum sqrt(eigenvalue))/(maximum sqrt(eigenvalue))
ME		measurement error, either 0 (no noise) or UN (10% uniform noise)



Generation process
-------------------

  1. weights:

    - set v_i := 2^((i-1)*W) for i=1..K
    - set w_i := v_i / sum_i{v_i}
    
  2. means:

    - each entry is drawn uniformly at random from the interval [0,A]
    - (finally, the means are scaled as to fit the given separation)
    
  3. covariances:

    preliminaries
	* set v_i := 2^(i*EW_exp) for i=1..K and normalize them by setting v_i := v_i / max_j{v_j}.
	* denote by uniform(a,b) a value that is drawn uniformly at random from the interval [a,b]
	
    for each k=1..K
    - set "minimal eigenvalue of Sigma_k"  :=  EW-min + v_i * (EW-max - EW-min)
      i.e. the minimal EWs of the covariances are increasing exponentially in a way that is determined by EW_exp
    - set "maximal eigenvalue of Sigma_k"  :=  "minimal eigenvalue of Sigma_k" + uniform(EWP_min, EWP_max) * "minimal eigenvalue of Sigma_k "
    - set lambda_kd = uniform("minimal eigenvalue of Sigma_k", "maximal eigenvalue of Sigma_k") for d=1..D
    - set Q_k = random orthonormal matrix
    - set Sigma_k = Q_k^T * diag(lambda_k1..lambda_kD) 
   
   
   
Hints:

  - EW-exp controls the ratio between the minimum eigenvalues between the different covariances,
    i.e. how different the sizes of the clusters are (in terms of expansion in space...)
   
  - EW-min = EW-max   => all Covariances have the same MINIMAL eigenvalue
  
  - EWP-min = EWP_max => all Covariances have the same ratio between maximum and minimum eigenvalue
  - EWP-min = EWP_max = 1 => all Covariances are **SPHERICAL**
  
  - EW-min = EW-max and EWP-min = EWP_max => all Covariances have the same minimum and maximum eigenvalue
  - EW-min = EW-max and EWP-min = EWP_max = 1 => all Covariances are spherical and share the same eigenvalue, i.e., EW-min
